# eratosthenes
OverviewPrime numbers are specific natural numbers with the property of having only two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and the number itself. The Eratosthenesâ€™ sieve is an iterative algorithm to find among a list of numbers from [2,N], -where N is a natural number, all the existing primes. InstructionsWrite a program which has asinput a text file, each line in the text file contains a number in increasing order from 2 to N. Using several processes Pi, where each process is responsible to delete the multiples of ifrom the file, create a program to identify among [2,N] all the prime numbers.
